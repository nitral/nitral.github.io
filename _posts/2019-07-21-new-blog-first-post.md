I have created websites before and have owned a Wordpress blog as well. However, I have always wanted to [own my personal website](https://www.alwaysownyourplatform.com) - a blog and a portfolio rolled into one. So, this is just a **First Post** for my new blog. You should now probably check out all the interesting content in here!

Also just in case you were wondering, I migrated 3 of my posts from my earlier Wordpress blog.

I am curious as well to know how this will go. Thanks for reading! Hope you have fun learning something new here!
