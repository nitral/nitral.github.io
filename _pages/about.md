title: Hello World! I'm Nilay.
---
I’m a software engineer at Google where I work on [Procella](https://dataworkssummit.com/san-jose-2018/session/procella-a-fast-versatile-youtube-scale-sql-query-engine-powering-datayoutube "DataWorks Summit 2018 Presentation by Aniket Mokashi"), a peta-scale, distributed, columnar SQL query engine. Before this, I received my Master’s in Computer Science from [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu) where I spent my time exploring deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and information retrieval. While in the pioneer valley, I also enjoyed having many (at times heated) discussions on philosophy, sociology, and design!

**I love having conversations!**

Before that, I worked for [Media.net](https://www.media.net) as a software engineer on their contextual advertising programmatic bidding offering. This was right after I received my Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering from [BITS-Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/index.aspx) where I led the [BITS Firefox Community](https://www.facebook.com/HivePilani), participated in the [Boot2Gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/B2G_OS) project, interned at [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com) and [Qubole](https://www.qubole.com), competed in many programming contests, built some bots, organized and wrote [software for a marathon](/posts/twin-brothers-of-the-education-system), delivered [talks](https://www.slideshare.net/nilaybinjola), and pwned n00bs in video games :raised_hands:, among [many other things](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilaybinjola)!

Want to get in touch? Send me an [email](mailto:nilaybinjola@gmail.com), or message me on some social media platform!
